# discord-rpc-client
User friendly method of creating custom Discord Rich presences in JS. Allows for full customization using the discord-rpc NPM module.

This project has been archived on 05/09/2021, due to issues with getting it to work, and the limitations of the NPM module. This may make a return in another language or even in JS when I am more experienced.
